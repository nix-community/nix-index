//! A compact encoding for file tree entries based on sharing prefixes.
//!
//! This module contains a rust implementation of a variant of the `frcode` tool
//! used by GNU findutils' locate. It has been extended to allow meta information
//! to be attached to each entry so it is no longer compatible with the original
//! frcode format.
//! (See http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/findutils/locatedb.5.html for a description of the frcode format.)
//!
//! The basic building block of the encoding is a line. Each line has the following format:
//! (the spaces are for readability only, they are not present in the encoding)
//!
//! ```text
//! <metadata> <\x00 byte> <shared prefix differential> <additional path bytes> <newline character>
//! ```
//!
//! Each entry holds two parts of data: metadata, which is just some arbitrary blob of NUL-terminated bytes
//! and a path. Because we are storing file trees, the path will likely share a long prefix with the previous
//! entry's path (we traverse directory entries in sorted order to maximize this chance), so we first store
//! the length of the shared prefix.
//!
//! Since this length will likely be similar to the previous one (if there are many entries in `/foo/bar`, then they will
//! all share a prefix of at least the length of `/foo/bar`) we only store the signed *difference* to the previous shared prefix length
//! (This is why it's called a differential). For differences smaller than +/-127 we store them directly as a single byte. If the
//! difference is greater than that, the first byte will by `0x80` (-128) indicating that the following two bytes represent the
//! difference (with the high byte first [big endian]).
//!
//! As an example, consider the following non-encoded plaintext, where `:` separates the metadata from the path:
//!
//! ```text
//! d:/
//! d:/foo
//! d:/foo/bar
//! f:/foo/bar/test.txt
//! f:/foo/bar/text.txt
//! d:/foo/baz
//! ```
//!
//! This text would be encoded as (using `[v]` to indicate a byte with the value of v)
//!
//! ```text
//! d[0][0]/
//! d[0][1]foo
//! d[0][3]/bar
//! f[0][4]/test.txt
//! f[0][3]xt.txt
//! d[0][-4]z
//! ```
//!
//! At the beginning, there is no previous entry, so the shared prefix length must always be `0` (and so must the shared prefix differential).
//! The second entry shares `1` byte with the first path so the difference is `1`. The third entry shares `4` bytes with the second one, which
//! is `3` more than the shared length of the second one, so we encode a `3` followed by the non-shared bytes, and so on for the remaining entries.
//! The last entry shares four bytes less than the second to last one did with its predecessor, so here the differential is negative.
//!
//! Through this encoding, the size of the index is typically reduces by a factor of 3 to 5.
